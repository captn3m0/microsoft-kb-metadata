# Microsoft Knowledge Base metadata

This repository hosts a small subset of the Microsoft Knowledgebase metadata. The data in the `data.json` contains the following:

1. Date of the KB publication
2. KB UUID
3. KB Slug
4. KB URL

The list of KB IDs in the database is scraped from the URLs in `discovery.txt`. The primary usecase of the dataset is to provide a `KB:DATE`
mapping to other projects.
